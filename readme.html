<p>
  This app requires access to <b>port 1175</b> on your Phantom host(s) in order to function properly.
</p>

<p>
The Infoblox ActiveTrust Platform has been replaced by the Infoblox BloxOne Platform (csp.infoblox.com).
Users need to migrate to the new platform to continue to use Dossier. This fix/update migrates the
phantom dossier integration to the new platform to ensure users are able to continue to utilize this integration.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note: </b> Users will need a new API key.
</p>
<p>
Users will need to get a new API key from the BloxOne Platform - ActiveTrust Platform API will not be valid.
</p>
