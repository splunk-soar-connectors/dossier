This app requires access to **port 1175** on your Phantom host(s) in order to function properly.

The Infoblox ActiveTrust Platform has been replaced by the Infoblox BloxOne Platform
(csp.infoblox.com). Users need to migrate to the new platform to continue to use Dossier. This
fix/update migrates the phantom dossier integration to the new platform to ensure users are able to
continue to utilize this integration.

**Note:** Users will need a new API key.

Users will need to get a new API key from the BloxOne Platform - ActiveTrust Platform API will now
be invalid.
